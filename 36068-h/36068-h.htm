<h2>TO THE PUBLIC.</h2>


<p><span style="float:left;"><img src="images/i_dropw.png" alt="W" title="W" /></span>e received so many kind assurances from friends in this
neighborhood and from gentlemen at a distance who
had taken an interest in our first little work, that they
induce us to issue this more comprehensive volume
containing about one hundred new pieces. We have written a number
of dairy odes recently; these and our patriotic songs composed during
the past year we trust will make the work more interesting. We publish
a few short pieces from many letters and poems we received from
friends. We hope the public will peruse the poems in a friendly
spirit, as a kind feeling towards all of the nationalities forming this
young and vigorous Dominion has prompted us to publish these selections
from our poetic works.</p>

<h2>SHORT EXTRACTS FROM POEMS AND LETTERS
RECEIVED BY THE AUTHOR.</h2>


<p>The following lines were received from Mr. William Murray of Hamilton:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In writing you do not pretend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Tennysonian themes to blend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is an independent style<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begotten on Canadian soil."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<hr class="short" />

<p>From one of Toronto's well known citizens, S. H. Janes, Esq.,
formerly of Oxford:</p>

<p>I wish to express to you my great pleasure in looking over your
musings on the Banks of Canadian Thames. It seemed to transport
my memory across the chasm of twenty-five years and to call up the
scenes, associations and joys of boyhood's happy hour. Literary work
of this kind must add greatly to your pleasure and happiness as it
certainly does to that of your friends.</p>


<hr class="short" />

<p>The Editor of the Toronto Globe, after reviewing a number of
other books pronounced our little volume to be the gem of the table.</p>


<hr class="short" />

<p>Col. Denison, Toronto's police magistrate, "found many most interesting
pieces on Canadian subjects in the volume."</p>


<hr class="short" />

<p>Joaquin Miller, the American poet, hailed me as "my dear poet of
the Canadian pasture fields," and he said I did wisely in singing of
useful themes.</p>


<hr class="short" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>N. C. Thompson of Rockford, Ill., wrote us a large number of
verses. We select the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Your poem on the Bard of Ayr,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I like the best, I think it rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An equal love of Burns I share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And read him oft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O could I write like him 'twould bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul aloft."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<hr class="short" />

<p>Dr. Scadding, the Antiquarian, thought my poem on Father
Rannie, the cheese pioneer, "had the ring of a fine old ballad about it."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>From a poem by the Rev. John Dunbar, of Toronto, we give this
extract:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As other duties made demand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only got your poems scanned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marking the treatment of your pieces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While wonder and surprise increases,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assured your book its way will win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So neat without, so nice within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reserving as a promised pleasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thorough reading at my leisure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Permit me now to each unknown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thank you for the kindness shown.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<hr class="short" />

<p>The Hon. Oliver Mowat was pleased with the patriotic spirit
displayed in the poems.</p>


<hr class="short" />

<p>From George McIntyre of Conestoga:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Surprised, delighted, beyond measure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gazed upon the pretty treasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as it gives me such great pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My thanks I send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him who in his hours of leisure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those verses penned.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="short" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>A. G. Murray, a prominent clansman of Chicago, sent us the
following:&mdash;I received your volume and I think a great deal of it. It
is one of our family treasures and the reading of it brings before us the
genial form of friend McIntyre, who pictures things so vividly, reminding
us of days gone by.</p>

<hr class="short" />


<p>From Rev. Robert Cameron of Denver, Colorado:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My whilom friend dear McIntyre,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Many a separate division,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among them there was no cohesion.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But statesmen saw that a great nation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could be formed by federation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon they led public opinion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To favor forming this Dominion.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">North-West with its streams and fountains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sources in the Rocky Mountains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was all a great mystery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunting for furs its history.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though North-West is filling slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet soon there will be mighty flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Millions to North-West will hurry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In last decade of century.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For therein is an opening grand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In great fertile prairie land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there the choicest wheat it grows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near where the Saskatchewan flows.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And on many a river's branch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is found great grazing ranch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Favoured districts therein abound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where cattle graze all the year round.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Protected from the stormy blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the Rocky Mountains vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through canon blows no storm terrific,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But balmy breezes from Pacific.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He knew a laborer he would be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever in the old country,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His forefathers had tilled the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never one had saved a pound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On beds of down they did not lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frugally their goods did buy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their one luxury around their door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few choice flowers their garden bore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He did bring sweet blooming bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such happiness is seldom seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happier far than king or queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She helped him in the fields to reap,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All they required they had for both,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And baked fine bread 'mong embers glow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He each winter the forest trees<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though good fortune now he sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might have been got from Walnut trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But trees were foes in his hurry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All were slain, both oak and cherry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to this day he doth incline<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And reflects how he did o'erwhelm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a maple, beech and elm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each summer day did toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his steers drawing logs in pile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These giants of the forest dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire did reduce to an ash bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon potatoes, wheat and corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They did the rugged stumps adorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jane did help him with the hoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well she did keep her row:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No organs then they had to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she could work and sing all day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spring he did live maples tap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To draw from them the luscious sap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gathered it in big log trough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then boiled it down and sugared off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough the household for to cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its sweets for the whole year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no such thing those times were seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the swift raising stump machine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where main road was low and damp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With logs he built a road through swamp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a smooth ride could not enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While it was naught but corduroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each year added earth and gravel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now smoothly o'er they can travel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it doth make an excellent road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For John and Jane to go abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it is now a great highway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where hundreds travel every day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were no roads in early days<br /></span>

<h2>LAMENT OF THE MAPLE TREE.</h2>

<p class="center">A VISION.</p>

<p class="center">"We had a dream which was not all a dream."&mdash;Byron.</p>


<div class="poem" style="width:21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I laid me down one day in June,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was late long afternoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A very sultry summer's eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such times the senses oft deceive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place was 'neath a maple tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon from all cares and troubles free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a gentle, kindly slumber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more our sorrows we could number,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we heard a plaintive wail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as we find in fairy tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the genius of the tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in sad guise appeared to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then she sadly did give vent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto this awful grave lament:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I am gay in month of June,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All decked in green, yet very soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas my beauty will be faded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my charms be all degraded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For is my time of glory brief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So often flattered is my leaf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Canada so broad and free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All poets sing of the maple tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High I stand in their opinion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emblem of the New Dominion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reason I do them upbraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some never slept beneath my shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet they take the liberty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To chant about the maple tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They dare to poetise my leaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the source of all my grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think their praises all so rude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as but base ingratitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So often hackneyed is my name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That every fall I burn with shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like maiden's cheek which blushes red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When vain rash youth asks her to wed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then do these foolish ones descry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In me fresh beauty and they sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then renew their songs of praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But unto me how sad their lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For then I know my days are brief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis hectic flush upon my leaf;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True poets then should mournful sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the destroyer's on the wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For then I know my leaves of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will all soon mingle with the mould,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one does ever think to praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fell destroyer when he slays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None rejoice in the flushed cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the poor girl is low and weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps they'll say and it is true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spring my glories I'll renew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 'tis poor comfort after all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lose my offspring every fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small consolation to mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell her that soon another<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will replace her fond darling boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has been source of all her joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you know all about my wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know that it is strong and good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have full many a curl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pleasing eye and charming nurl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some love me as fond nature grained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some prefer my beauty stained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my dear friend I hope that you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My varied shades love pure and true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For of the woods you know the staple<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stoutest and best is good maple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth my sugar eat with glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And old maids love me in their tea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In me do various uses meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In summer shade, in winter heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I do make a glorious blaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All worthy of the poet's lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to their praises I'll be deaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If more they harp about my leaf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call me gay when I am sober<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me 'tis gloomy month October,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But saints on earth when they die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope for true bliss beyond the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So winter does bring no alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though it strip bare my trunk and arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now I know that time will bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More glorious foliage in the spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all nature will rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphing with glorious voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And birds will in my branches sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hosannas to the lovely spring.<br /></span>

<h2>CANADA OUR HOME, 1883.</h2>


<p>The following response to Canada our home was given at a banquet
of the Caledonian Society, Ingersoll:</p>

<p>In responding to the sentiment Canada our home perhaps it would
be appropriate to point out the prominent and distinguishing characteristics
between the land of our nativity and the land of our adoption.
In this Canada of ours we have no bonny blooming heath, no banks
and braes covered o'er with daisies and gowans, no fragrant hedges
showering down white spray in the May time, no whin and broom
prodigal in their gaiety of yellow flowers, no hills nor glens where
fairies gambol in pleasant and harmless sport, no grand ruins of ancient
cathedrals and castles, no feathered songsters like the mavis and
blackbird.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full oft we did enraptured hark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heavenly song of the skylark.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Canada is a young giant in its infancy with the noblest chain
of lakes in the world on its frontier, and the most magnificent river
the St. Lawrence. This land also possesses the largest fertile wilderness
on the globe, but it is one which will ere many years have passed
away, blossom like a garden, and where naught but grass and flowers
now grow in wild luxuriance. Soon the husbandman will plow and
sow and reap a rich reward in yellow golden grain. Domestic cattle
quiet will graze where now the Buffalos roam and in spots now covered
o'er with Indian wigwams, where white men never trod cities will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
occupy their sites with busy trade and millions flock from eastern lands
to take possession of the great Northwest. Then Winnipeg perchance
may be the capital of the Dominion. In the day foretold when this indeed
shall be the "Greater Britain" with Ontario's towns for workshops
for this vast prairie land.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:27em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then poets will arise and high their lays will soar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worthy of the muse of a Burns or a Moore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Shakespeare and a Milton, the great and the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will sing of the glories of our northern skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its lakes and rivers and its mountains grand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its fertile plains and great prairie land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fit theme for song this empire gigantic,<br /></span>

<h3>GEORGE MENZIES' POEMS, 1883.</h3>

<p>About one third of a century ago there flourished in Canada three

<h3>ROBERT FLEMING GOURLEY.</h3>

<p>Robert F. Gourley was a graduate of St. Andrew's University,
Scotland. He was the first to agitate for popular rights in Canada.
He was banished from the country and while crossing the Niagara
River he asked for a brush to wipe Canadian dust from his feet.
He became a champion of popular rights in England and he whipped
Lord Brougham in the lobby of the House of Commons, for which
breach of privilege he was sentenced by the House. Mr. Gourley
owned several farms in Oxford, Ontario, and sought to represent South
Oxford in 1858, but Dr. Connor, an uncle of Hon. E. Blake, won the
seat; Mr. Blake was his uncle's secretary through the contest when he
was a youth.</p>

<h2>DAIRY AND CHEESE ODES.</h2>


<p>As cheese making first began in this county and it has already
become the chief industry of many counties, it is no insignificant theme.
About the middle of this century Canada was a great importer of
cheese, and now cheese is the principal article of export from the
Province of Ontario, and this Province will soon export no less than
ten millions of dollars worth of cheese per annum. Mr. Ranney was
doing a thriving business in the dairy line, manufacturing cheese after
the century was half gone on the dairy plan from the products of his
own cows, and one decade later Mr. Farrington introduced the factory
system. Both of these gentlemen have departed this life but Canada
is enjoying the fruits of their labors, and about eight hundred cheese
factories are in operation in this Province of Ontario.</p>

<span class="i0">Since Farrington went to Norwich,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the system first there began<br /></span>

<p>Among the earliest champions of the Factory System of making
cheese were Messrs. Chadwick, Casswell and Ballantyne. The North
Oxford Company were awarded the highest honor at the Centennial
Exhibition. Messrs. J. L. Grant &amp; Co. have a fine large cold storage
warehouse on the G.T.R., and the C.P.R. have erected one on their
line, which is leased by Mr. Riley. Ingersoll being the great dairy
centre of Ontario it was deemed requisite to have those facilities for
preserving the cheese in the hot season. The following is a list of the
most prominent cheese factories in this district and the salesmen
thereof:</p>

<span class="i0">A buffalo, lord of the plain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While voyaging on northern seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For days we could not catch a breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But were held fast as if in vice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surrounded by the bergs of ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We could not move the ship or boat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on low, flat iceberg we did float;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of provisions we took good store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With big oars we rowed the berg to shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pride and joy each one feels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we had caught ten thousand seals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our brave boys each one they dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To boldly capture great white bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On floating berg we built with boards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A storehouse for to hold our hordes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We had a stove and stock of coal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we enjoyed this voyage droll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In centre of berg we dug a hole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And erected a strong pole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frost and ice soon held it fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well it served us for a mast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which we stretched out our sails<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On the highest mountain top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which graceful down to sea did slope,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our island soon away did float<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if it was a mighty boat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can you believe this wondrous tale?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It proved to be a monster whale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the ocean quick it flew<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our crew in great wealth each on shares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By selling whale and seals and bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We hired steam tug to reach our ship,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I never thought there would be any,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But alas, I found many;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bush was thick and mat and tangle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It made it a perfect jungle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one mile square of good dry land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was enough for me to take in hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swamp I could reach but when frozen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I saw bears by the dozen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick as monkies in Africa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a strange trick I saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gamboling with the greatest ease,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So heavy laden through the snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I him full soon did overtake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his courage quick I did shake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For by the leg my good bold dog<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bravely caught the thievish rogue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this move made him soon fork o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me at once the largest porker,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But up he rose and quick he run,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bear now scared his only hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let at once the other pig drop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shot the bear right through the eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And secured a valued prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's nothing I love so to eat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In winter time as the bear's meat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So a victory I soon won<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That night I set a good spring gun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rails I built for him a run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Open all way to hive of bees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tried again a hive to seize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all his efforts were in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sprung the gun and he was slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the fact I felt quite funny<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It well repaid me for my honey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One bear was playing on me joke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carrying off all my young stock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I set my trap, built round it fence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved he ne'er would get from thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at the first he did me hoax,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he was cunning as a fox,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dug under and stole my bait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I next sunk trap and sealed his fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My good iron trap again it caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A great bear but it came to naught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breakfast he had at my expense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he then showed wondrous sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trap he picked up with greatest ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dashed it to pieces on the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But blacksmith soon did it repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I was bound to have that bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I attached to trap a heavy clog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was like lifting a small log,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I drove in it some sharp iron spikes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which would cut deep each time he strikes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tried again to steal my bait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And break my trap at the old rate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he soon dashed out his own brains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His carcass it brought me great gains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A neighbour man who would not work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought that he did steal my pork,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at last I found long black hairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I knew it was the bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I put through barrels rods of iron<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they a bear neck would environ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rods together they would snap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found him choked quite dead in trap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since then my strife with bears did cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now many years I've lived in peace.<br /></span>

<h2>WARS IN QUEEN VICTORIA'S REIGN.</h2>


<div class="poem" style="width:23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We will now sing in thoughtful strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wars in Queen Victoria's reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Russian bear did ages lurk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ready for to spring on Turk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Russian statesmen did divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they should conquer Constantine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But like a greyhound after hare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lion did drive back the Bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made it feel the British rule<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At gates of strong Sebastopol.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then insolent was Persia,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Lion had to dictate law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while engaged in scenes like these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was attacked by the Chinese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for this outrage all so wanton<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He then resolved to seize on Canton.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon there came a dismal cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of slaughter'd Britons from Delhi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bengal Tiger sick with gore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did tremble at the Lion's roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Britain got a serious shock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By losing of brave Havelock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Campbell 'mid a numerous foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full quick these armed hosts did o'erthrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Abyssinian dungeons vile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay captives of Great Britain's isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon the tyrant Theodore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay sadly weltering in his gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The savage tribes of Ashantee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From British troops did quickly flee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Afghan and Zulu wars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many did find their deadly scars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the land of the Pharaohs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Christians suffered cruel woes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till in Alexandria Bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The British iron clads did display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty power they did wield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While their steel sides from harm did shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And British army on the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marched bravely o'er the burning sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Arabi found 'twas useless labor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His strong trench of Tel-el-Kebir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Egyptians did not wish to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their breasts cold British steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their great power was soon laid low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Wolseley entered Grand Cairo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Egyptians now no more revile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Christians on the banks of Nile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have sung three heroes' names.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Havelock from the land of Thames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Campbell from the banks of Clyde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Wolseley from Liffy's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rose, thistle, shamrock unite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They do prove victors in the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Britain once more does command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Respect alike on sea and land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now may wars forever cease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mankind ever live in peace.<br /></span>

<p>At the announcement that Britain was to declare war Kossuth the

<div class="poem" style="width:31em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the British Lion offered aid to the Turk,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They said he was at home on sea, but when on land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would be as a ship wrecked upon the strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or like some huge ungainly crocodile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the marshy banks of sluggish Nile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who could move gaily on the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on dry land could scarcely creep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But up the Alma heights he rushed like greyhound after hare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a moment by the throat he seized the Russian bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which begged so hard for mercy his life he did it spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And closely now it is confined within its native lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For its strong fortress of Sebastpol<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was forced to submit to Great Britain's rule.<br /></span>

<p>Entwining of the thistle around the maple tree, Scotia's sons have
indented their names deep in Canadian history. The names of McDonald,
McKenzie, Cameron and Mowat stand conspicuous, and Brown
second to none. For wealth, enterprise and benevolence those Montreal
Scotsmen stand high, Sir Donald A. Smith, Sir George Stephens
and Duncan McIntyre.</p>

<h2>ADVICE TO A LITTLE GIRL.</h2>

<p>The following lines were written at the request of a little girl,
who said she would recite them at a Sunday School entertainment.
Prof. J. S. Blackie of Edinburgh, in a letter acknowledging the receipt

memory in the public schools. Sir Daniel Wilson of Toronto University
also approves of them as containing good sentiments and should be
impressed on the minds of the young.</p>

Produced by Meredith Bach, Leonard Johnson and the Online
Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This
book was produced from scanned images of public domain
material from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
